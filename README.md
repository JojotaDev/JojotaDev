- 👋    Hi, I’m @JojotaDev. (that's a Jojo reference)
- 🧙🏻‍♂️    My friends calls me Jota. I'm a level 26 wizard.
- 💑    I am a family man who loves to spend time with my partner and that ball of fur I see as my own daughter. 🐈
- 💙    My favorite part of the day is at nigth, when I'm coding while having a coffee and listening to my spotify playlist. 🌙 👨🏻‍💻☕🎧
- 🤹🏻‍♂️    I used to practice juggling while I was on the circus club at college.
- 🌟    I'm interested in sharpening my developer skills by studying and practicing new technologies and tools. Then I like to apply them to my personal projects.
- 🌱    I’m currently learning Angular and NodeJS.
- 💞️    I’m looking to collaborate on areas that make contributions to society like the environment, health and education.
- 📫    If you want to contact me you can have a look at my portfolio and leave me a message there 😄
